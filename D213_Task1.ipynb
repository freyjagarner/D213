    "### A.  Describe the purpose of this data analysis by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Summarize one research question that you will answer using neural network models and NLP techniques. Be sure the research question is relevant to a real-world organizational situation and sentiment analysis captured in your chosen dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Define the objectives or goals of the data analysis. Be sure the objectives or goals are reasonable within the scope of the research question and are represented in the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.  Identify a type of neural network capable of performing a text classification task that can be trained to produce useful predictions on text sequences on the selected data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### B.  Summarize the data cleaning process by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Perform exploratory data analysis on the chosen dataset, and include an explanation of each of the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  presence of unusual characters (e.g., emojis, non-English characters, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*  vocabulary size\n",
    "\n",
    "*  proposed word embedding length\n",
    "\n",
    "*  statistical justification for the chosen maximum sequence length\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Describe the goals of the tokenization process, including any code generated and packages that are used to normalize text during the tokenization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.  Explain the padding process used to standardize the length of sequences, including the following in your explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  if the padding occurs before or after the text sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "*  a screenshot of a single padded sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.  Identify how many categories of sentiment will be used and an activation function for the final dense layer of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.  Explain the steps used to prepare the data for analysis, including the size of the training, validation, and test set split.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part IV:  Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### D.  Evaluate the model training process and its relevant outcomes by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.  Discuss the impact of using stopping criteria instead of defining the number of epochs, including a screenshot showing the final training epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  Provide visualizations of the modelâ€™s training process, including a line graph of the loss and chosen evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.  Assess the fitness of the model and any measures taken to address overfitting.\n",
